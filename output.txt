In response to parties expressing concerns that section 706 could be read to impose regulations on edge providers 
or others in the Internet ecosystem, see, e.g., Disney et al. Reply at 2; ITIF Comments at 9-10, we emphasize that 
today’s rules apply only to last-mile broadband providers.  We reject calls from other commenters to exercise our 
section 706 authority to adopt open Internet regulations for edge providers. See, e.g., ACA Comments at 47-48; Cox

See Hurwitz Comments at 12 (arguing that the best path forward would be to adopt general policy guidelines that

  Our conclusions are not 
premised on the assumption that regulation never harms investment, nor do we deny that deregulation

overall broadband investment.  This is further supported by examining broadband providers’ investment 
histories since the announcement of the Broadband Classification NOI in 2010.  While the Commission

we forbear from application of many of Title II’s provisions to broadband Internet 
access services, and in doing so, provide the regulatory certainty necessary to continued investment and

require broadband providers “to create, and then tariff, a termination service for Internet content under 
Section 203 of the Communications Act.”

  For similar reasons we reject as inconsistent with

the grant of forbearance will itself spur conduct that mitigates the need for the forborne-from

forbearance in the public interest under section 10(a)(3), see id., nothing in the text of section 10 makes such a 
finding a necessary prerequisite for forbearance where the Commission can make the required findings under section

or all of the forbearance granted in this Order.  See, e.g., Full Service Network/TruConnect Feb. 3, 2015 Ex Parte

assertions that we should not forbear as to particular provisions or regulations without any meaningful 
supporting analysis or discussion under the section 10(a) framework.
--
--
commenters argue for a narrower result than the forbearance we grant here, such conclusory arguments do 
not undercut our finding that the section 10(a) criteria are met as to the forbearance granted here with 
respect to broadband Internet access service.  For similar reasons we reject arguments that the 
Commission should “exempt from forbearance… Section 228… provid[ing] customers with protections 
from abusive practices by pay-per-call service providers” insofar as they do not explain how such a

47 U.S.C. § 160(a)(1).

--
706—we limit our forbearance from the relevant provisions and regulations to the context of broadband Internet 
access service. Outside that context, they will continue to apply as they have previously, unaffected by this Order.  
We thus reject claims that the actions or analysis  here effectively treat forborne-from provisions or regulations as 
surplusage or that we are somehow ignoring significant portions of the Act.  See Pai Dissent at 61, 64;  O’Rielly 
Dissent at 14-15.
--
--
As explained above, we conclude that while competition can be a sufficient basis to grant forbearance, it is not 
inherently necessary in order to find section 10 satisfied.  See supra Section V.A.  Given our assessment of the 
advantages of the regulatory framework applied under this Order, we also reject suggestions that, where the 
Commission does not rely on sufficient competition to justify forbearance, alternative ex ante regulations would 
always be necessary to ensure just and reasonable conduct and otherwise provide a basis for finding the section 
--
--
a large possible universe of broadband Internet access service providers, we do not find a basis to conclude that they 
all—or a sufficiently significant number of them—are likely to be simultaneously subject to complaints to render the 
case-by-case approach unworkable or inferior to additional bright line rules, and thus reject concerns to the contrary.  
See Pai Dissent at 63.
1503
--
--
  Commenters do not meaningfully explain why the transparency rule is inadequate, and thus their 
arguments do not persuade us to depart from our section 10(a) findings above in the case of section 203.
504. We likewise reject the proposals of other commenters that we structure our forbearance 
from section 203 to permissively, rather than mandatorily, detariff broadband Internet access service.
1526
--
--
506. We find forbearance from applying certain enforcement-related provisions of Title II 
beyond the core Title II enforcement authority discussed above warranted under section 10(a), and we 
reject arguments to the contrary.
1532
  Section 205 provides for Commission investigation of existing rates 
--
--
forbearance is in the public interest under section 10(a)(3).
1536
  We thus reject claims that forbearance 
from section 205, insofar as it is triggered by our classification of broadband Internet access service, is 
not warranted.
--
--
discontinuance approval requirements.
1554
We reject the arguments of some commenters that we should 
not forbear, which focus in particular on concerns about discontinuances in rural areas or areas with only 
one provider.
--
--
We thus forbear from applying section 214 discontinuance requirements to the extent 
that they would be triggered by our classification of broadband Internet access service here.
511. We also reject arguments against forbearance from applying section 214 to enable the 
Commission to engage in merger review.
1561
--
--
1575
  Because we retain our authority to apply and enforce these 
other protections, we reject commenters’ suggestion that the section 10(a) forbearance criteria are not met 
as to sections 251 and 256.

Internet Access Service 
537. While we address above specific arguments against forbearance as to particular 
provisions or requirements, we note that we also reject certain overarching concerns about our 
forbearance decision here.  For one, we grant substantial forbearance in this item, rather than deferring 
such forbearance decisions to future proceedings.
--
--
section 10(a) criteria are met with respect to the forbearance we grant, and taking such action here enables 
us to strike the right regulatory and deregulatory balance regarding broadband Internet access service, as 
discussed above.  Under these circumstances we reject arguments that we should defer forbearance to 
future proceedings.
1660
--
--
1660
  Likewise, given our finding that the section 10(a) criteria are met for the 
forbearance adopted here, we reject generalized arguments that the scope of forbearance here should be 
the same as that historically granted in the CMRS context.
1661
--
--
  Further, because we grant
substantial forbearance in this Order rather than deferring those issues to a future proceeding, we also 
reject concerns that the process of obtaining forbearance will be burdensome or uncertain, insofar as they 
are based on a presumption that such relief only would be granted via subsequent proceedings.

distinguishable from the circumstances underlying the Brand X case, where a court had classified cable modem 
service as a telecommunications service without simultaneous forbearance of the sort we adopt here, and thus we 
reject arguments seeking to rely on court filings there.  See, e.g., Cox Reply at 10 & n.36 (quoting Petition for a Writ 
of Certiorari by U.S. Dept. of Justice and FCC, FCC v. Brand X Internet Servs., No. 04-281, at 25-26 (Aug. 27,

anticipating vibrant intermodal competition” were wrong.
144
To get to the point:  Could someone reading the Notice have anticipated the FCC might reject its 
past proposals and tentative conclusions and instead pursue reclassification?  Perhaps.  Anything is 
possible.  But should the public have anticipated the FCC would move forward with reclassification 
--
--
Although many parties discussed Internet traffic exchange during the comment period, they did so 
because the Notice asked if the FCC should change course and apply the Part 8 rules to IP 
interconnection, a proposal the Order squarely rejects today.  The submissions during the comment period 
say nothing about a Title II-based backstop—and even a cursory review of those filings shows that no 
party anticipated the approach the Order now adopts.
--
--
and is thus an interconnected service, a commercial mobile service, and a 
telecommunications service.
But this isn’t a new argument—the Commission squarely addressed it and rejected it seven years 
ago.
324
--
--
334
So it’s no wonder that when the FCC first defined “the public switched network,” it expressly 
rejected calls to decouple that concept from the traditional public switched telephone network.  
Commenters had asked the Commission to broaden the scope of the term to include the then-emerging 
“network of networks.”
--
--
1994 to broaden the scope of the term “the public switched network” to include the “network of networks,” or 
otherwise separate the term entirely from the traditional public switched telephone network.  See Order at note 1145.  
Again, this ignores that the Commission rejected those commenters’ calls to so fundamentally alter the term “the 
public switched network” and made clear that, consistent with section 332, it was limiting the term to covering 
services that are “interconnected with the traditional local exchange or interexchange switched network.”  CMRS 
--
--
thus part of the traditional public switched telephone network.
350
  In doing so, the Commission rejected all 
calls to define the terms so expansively as to include the Internet or otherwise fundamentally alter 
them.
--
--
449
  What’s the basis for this predictive judgment?  The Order doesn’t say, although it 
goes out of its way to “reject suggestions that market forces will be sufficient to ensure that providers of 
broadband Internet access service and broadband subscriber access service do not act in a manner 
contrary to the public interest.”
--
--
472
  But such reasoning implies the FCC could have 
pretty much ignored 90% of the Telecommunications Act—rejecting Congress’s entire framework for 
opening local markets to competition—based on the forbearance authority Congress gave the agency in 
that same act.  That makes no sense whatsoever.
--
--
15
  
While the FCC tailors certain statements from providers to reject assertions that Title II will 
“substantially diminish overall broadband investment”, that doesn’t give me a lot of comfort.
